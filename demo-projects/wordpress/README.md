# Wordpress
------
**This is NOT meant for production purposes!!**
This should work with all OS as long as you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.  Please report any issues you face and I'll take a look as soon as I can.

-------

### What does it do?
Generates a Docker container with any version of Wordpress. This helps anyone testing an extension or just wanting to play around with a test Wordpress site.

### How do I monitor the app created?
I personally use Docker Desktop but you can use Portainer or any other Docker monitoring system you want!

### Start Wordpress
Select the version from the dropdown and click on the "up" button below to create the app.
